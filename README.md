Various eigendecomposition implementations wrapped for jax.

## Credit
The high-level `eig` function and many of the tests are adapted from [fmmax](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fmmax/tree/main/src/fmmax). The torch implementation of eigendecomposition is due to a [comment](https://github.com/google/jax/issues/10180#issuecomment-1092098074) by @YouJiacheng.
